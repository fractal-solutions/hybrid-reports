    "Improve monitoring coverage: 62% monitoring score suggests gaps in monitoring coverage. Review and expand monitoring policies to cover all critical devices.",
    "Enhance antivirus coverage: While 76% coverage is good, 10 devices lack antivirus protection. Deploy antivirus to remaining devices to reach 100% coverage.",
    "Investigate device health failures: Only 2 out of 46 devices passed all health checks. Conduct detailed investigation on the 44 failed devices to identify root causes.",
    "Review disk space monitoring: Current analysis shows no low disk space issues, but ensure proactive monitoring thresholds are set to prevent future problems."
