    "Resolve disk‑space issues: 2 devices have less than 15% free space on the system drive. Clean up unnecessary files or expand storage to prevent performance and stability problems.",
    "Reduce monitoring alerts: The monitoring score is 63% due to 129 high‑priority alerts unresolved. Investigate and resolve these alerts to improve network health and service delivery.",
    "Enhance overall device compliance: Only 1 out of 25 devices passed all health checks. Review the failing checks (especially disk space and patch status) and implement corrective actions.",
    "Ensure antivirus coverage on remaining devices: 2 devices lack up‑to‑date antivirus protection. Verify installation and update status to maintain a 100% coverage target."
