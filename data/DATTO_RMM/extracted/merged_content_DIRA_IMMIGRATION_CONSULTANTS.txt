are delivered below.

Asset Management
The Asset Management score represents the capability of the network to function as is required by today's standards.
Compliancy checks are made against the device to ensure devices meet the set criteria. Included in the checks are Warranty
Status, Disk Capacity, Memory Capacity and if the Operating system is still supported.
Monitoring
The Monitoring score is influenced by the open monitoring alerts for the network. The total number of open alerts influence
the score, a higher priority is reflected by a increased weight in the calculation. A lower score means that issues are seen but
have not yet been resolved.
Patch Management
Regularly installing Microsoft Updates is essential for keeping the network secure. The Patch Management score represents
the current state of Microsoft Updates in the network.
Software Management
Keeping commonly used 3rd party software applications updated significantly helps keeping the network secure. Attackers
often try to exploit security vulnerabilities in these applications. This score indicates the compliance level of the managed
devices.
Antivirus
An Antivirus product on all devices is essential for keeping the network protected against malware and other threats. The
Antivirus Score represents if the Antivirus solution is installed, running and up to date on all devices.
Proactive Maintenance
Any network requires proactive maintenance to ensure its availability, security and performance. The report contains a list of
regularly scheduled automated activities. No score is calculated based on these activities.
