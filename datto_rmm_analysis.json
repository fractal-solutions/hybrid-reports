  "recommendations": [
    "Improve patch management: Only 4 out of 15 devices are fully patched. Schedule regular patch deployments and address installation errors.",
    "Address low disk space: 4 drives have less than 20GB free. Consider cleaning up unnecessary files or expanding storage.",
    "Enhance overall device health compliance: Only 2 devices passed all health checks. Investigate failing checks (RAM, OS support, etc.) and remediate.",
    "Ensure antivirus is up-to-date on all devices, even though score is 100%, verify definitions and real-time protection.",
    "Review software compliance: Software Management score is only 13%. Ensure all software is licensed and up-to-date.",
    "Monitor hardware lifecycle: 10 devices are suitable for 24+ months, but 5 may need replacement planning."
